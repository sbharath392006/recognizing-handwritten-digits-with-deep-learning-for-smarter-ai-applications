# Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Deep Learning for Smarter AI Applications

This project aims to build a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively classify images of digits (0-9), enabling smarter and more accurate AI applications.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic image classification problem with practical applications in digitizing forms, postal code reading, and automated banking systems. The objective is to train a model that accurately identifies digits from images.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a deep learning model for digit classification.
- Compare different neural network architectures (CNN vs. Dense).
- Maximize accuracy and generalization.
- Visualize learned features for interpretability.

## 🧠 Dataset
- **Name**: MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) / [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)
- **Images**: 70,000 (60,000 train + 10,000 test)
- **Type**: Grayscale 28x28 images
- **Classes**: 10 (digits 0 to 9)
